# Cyber1
Part 1
I completed 2 one star challenges, 2 three star challenges, and 2 five star challenges.

# Cyber2 
Rooms I did 
Easy  Vulnversity 
Easy  Introductory Researching
Medium  Attacktive Directory
Medium  Linux PrivEsc 
Hard  Penetration Testing Challenge
Hard  Retro 

You know what's interesting? Even though it wasn't planned, the order of these rooms at Vulnversity worked surprisingly well together. First, I dived into vulnerability research and doing some research, which acted as a quick refresher for what came next. Working on Linux privilege escalation helped me remember all those important commands I needed. Then, the penetration testing challenge and the retro challenge showed up on my radar. They had some similarities to the previous tasks, but in my humble opinion, the retro challenge proved to be tougher to crack. Overall, it was a great learning experience!
