# Cyber1
Part 1
I completed 2 one star challenges, 2 three star challenges, and 2 five star challenges.

# Cyber2 
Rooms I did 
Easy  Vulnversity 
Easy  Introductory Researching
Medium  Attacktive Directory
Medium  Linux PrivEsc 
Hard  Penetration Testing Challenge
Hard  Retro 

You know what's interesting? Even though it wasn't planned, the order of these rooms at Vulnversity worked surprisingly well together. First, I dived into vulnerability research and doing some research, which acted as a quick refresher for what came next. Working on Linux privilege escalation helped me remember all those important commands I needed. Then, the penetration testing challenge and the retro challenge showed up on my radar. They had some similarities to the previous tasks, but in my humble opinion, the retro challenge proved to be tougher to crack. Overall, it was a great learning experience!

Feeling quite confident, I decided to take on one of the seemingly impossible TryHackMe challenges called "You're in a cave." At first, I approached it with blind confidence, attempting a basic nmap scan to identify open and closed ports. However, I soon realized how unprepared I was for the challenge. Despite trying various tools like SSH, curl, and netcat (nc), I made no progress. After hitting this wall for about two and  a half hours, I decided to switch to another challenge, CCT2019, hoping for better luck.

Unfortunately, I found myself stuck in the same situation for about 70 min minutes until I realized that the file probably wasn't saving properly. Feeling increasingly frustrated, I shifted my attention to the "Insane" challenge named "Take Down" on TryHackMe, but even after an hour, I achieved no significant results.

Growing more disheartened, I tried my luck with the "Crock Crew" challenge on TryHackMe. Despite trying every approach I could think of, I was running out of ideas and options. At that moment, it seemed like an impossible task.

However, my luck took a turn when I stumbled upon the command "nmap -sS --min-rate 5000 -sCV -p- -A $ip -oN nmap_all.txt," which provided me with valuable information. It was only a small step forward, but it gave me hope. Further, using the "cat" command, I obtained even more information. The downside was that there was now an overwhelming amount of data to sift through. While going through everything, I found a link on GitHub and made a clone, which caused the IP to change.

At this point, I've spent three hours on this challenge and have made more progress than with the previous ones. Although I don't believe I'll complete it this week, I am learning alout since this is forcing me to learn without relying on guides.
